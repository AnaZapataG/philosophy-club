On the Introdoction to [Introduction to Philosophy](https://ppls.ed.ac.uk/philosophy/research/impact/free-online-courses/introduction-to-philosophy) by The University of Edinburgh we begin with the question What is Philosophy?. The course starts with the claim: Pilosophy is the activity of working out the right way of thinking about things. We can ask then what do they mean by activity? its is something that we can practice and then we can get better at? the author points to the idea that in order to understand what philosophy is you need to get stuck doing it. And that "so much of philosophy is learning specific tools and techniques to reason, argue and express yourself". 

The first part of the course is divided in four sections, the preoviousle mention What is philosophy is the first one. where this question is not the only one adress we also think about the idea that even though we try to think about things in the right way ( a question I later come about this idea about what is right? that Im glad they adress it) in other disciplines, the distinction with phyilosophy is that in philosophy we think about the right way of thinking about things. This idea of steping back from the subject, asking questions about the subject, what is that we are propising and if what we propose is the right way. They give two simple examples. Here is one: 
	1. When practicing medicine we try to heal or treat people acroding to our current best medical theories. 
	2. when doing philosophy of medicine, we might step back and think about wheter the concepts our best medical theores employ make sense, or what "helth" and "sickness" really mean. 
the following parts deal with the following: 2. Philosophy: Difficult, Important and Everywhere; 3. How to do philosophy. and 4: is there a right way of thinking about stuff?

I will briftly point out to the most important thing in each section. 

**Philosophy: Difficult, Important and Everywhere**: the question of the "fundamental" aspect of philosophy is brogught up. is not true when we think that we can still ask questions (important questions) and not call it philosophy. Its true when we understant this idea of pilosophy as the steping back and examining what we are asking and the way we are asking: what are the prepositions we are asking, are they the right ones? this idea of steping back is further strech to adress the importance of philosophy and how:" thinking clearly about the things that matter most to us". 

in **Philosophy: how to do it?** we are introduce to a vital part of philosophical thinking: evidence and reasoning. We are inroduce to a simple example (decide to go to the movies or not and to evidence to make a decicion (conclussion)). A very important part is introduce here: "part of doing philosophy is thinking about wheter or not particular arguments do a good job of establishing their conclussion" how do we question this? the ask. the answer presente is as follow: one way might be to ask if the true from the conclussion comes from the true of the evidence. If the premises are true, and the conclusion are true, we say the argument is valid. in the case the arguments are true but the conlusion is not, the argument is invalid. on the other way  when an argument is valid with true premises, we call it a sound argument. 

	logica de los argumentos. deductiva o inductiva. 

what i think to be the most interesting thing about this lessons is when its propose that is not all about the argument. To do this the introduce the folowing by H. Putnam: 

_“Philosophy needs vision and argument […] there is something_

_disappointing about a philosophical work that contains arguments,_

_however good, which are not inspired by some genuine vision, and_

_something disappointing about a philosophical work that contains a_

_vision, however inspiring, which is unsupported by arguments […]_

_Speculation about how things hang together requires […] the_

_ability to draw out conceptual distinctions and connections, and the_

_ability to argue […] But speculative views, however interesting or well
_supported by arguments or insightful, are not all we need. We also_

_need what [the philosopher Myles] Burnyeat called ‘vision’ – and I_

_take that to mean vision as to how to live our lives, and how to order_

_our societies.”_

we see here the idea of baring in mind the "big picture" of things. 

Finally in the 4 section they ask again is there a right way of thinking about stuff? introducing two thinkers [[Hume]] and [[Kant]]. The Hume preposition (que me gusta) has to do with a pesimistic view of the "right way" of thinking. Hume
